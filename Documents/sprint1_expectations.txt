By sprint 1â€™s end, we as a group will have understood the requirements and discussed the backlog of the project. We would have created backlogs on JIRA with at least 1 assigned to each of the group members.

We will have developed the first draft of the UML diagrams. The design of the software and the work flow will be decided.

We will have developed Entity Relationship Diagrams. We will show the overview of classes which will be implemented for showing the relation between them.

We will have discussed the user case scenarios. We will have an overview of UI ready which will be base for the implementation as well.

We will have gone through the Prattle code. We will have run the code locally and tested the client-server implementation working over a LAN.

We will have written tests for the Prattle code. The branch coverage of 85% would have been achieved for the given code.
